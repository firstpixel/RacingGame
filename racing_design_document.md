## 🔹 Phase 1: Core Game Mechanics (Single-Player Prototype)
### 🎯 Goal:  
Build a fully functional single-player prototype with working car physics, UI, and AI logic before integrating multiplayer.

### 🏇 Step 1: Implement Car Movement System
🔹 **Team:** Physics & Gameplay Engineers  

#### **1. Car Structure & Visuals**
- The car model will resemble a **Formula 1 car**.
- **Front wheels should turn** when steering to enhance realism.
- **Tire rotation animation** should reflect speed changes (faster = blurred effect).
- Add a **light shining effect** in the middle of the tire when accelerating.
- Apply **subtle tilt animation** to simulate weight shift during turns.

#### **2. Car Movement & Controls**
- Implement **basic movement mechanics** using arrow keys.
- **Acceleration and braking** must follow smooth curves (gradual increase/decrease).
- The car should have **momentum** (won’t stop instantly when releasing keys).
- Implement **turning behavior** with speed-dependent rotation.
- Add **drift mechanics** where grip reduces slightly on sharp turns.

#### **3. Camera & World Interaction**
- The **main game map rotates** so the player's car is always moving **upward**.
- The **camera follows the player** while keeping the car slightly toward the bottom of the screen.
- Leave **extra space below the car** to allow visibility when reversing.
- The camera should have **slight lateral movement and rotation smoothing** to enhance turning sensation.

#### **4. Bounding Box Collision Detection**
- Use **bounding box collision detection** to keep the car inside track limits.
- Implement **collision reaction mechanics** (reduce speed on impact, slight bounce effect).
- Prevent the car from cutting corners by detecting **off-track movement**.
- Prepare **support for dynamic track elements** (e.g., walls, barriers).

#### **5. Environmental Effects**
- Introduce **motion blur at high speeds**.
- Implement **random rain effects** that reduce grip and increase drift behavior.
- Adjust **physics in wet conditions** (longer braking distances, reduced acceleration).
- Generate **tire marks on sharp turns**, which fade over time for realism.

---

### 🎯 Step 2: Load Tracks & Implement Collision Handling
🔹 **Team:** Game World Developers  

#### **1. Track System Setup**
- Load **pre-designed SVG race tracks** dynamically based on the selected track.

#### **2. Track Rendering & Display**
- Render the **track as a background** while keeping it interactive.
- Ensure the **track scales properly** to different screen sizes.
- Implement **track rotation mechanics**, ensuring it aligns with the player’s movement direction.

#### **3. Collision Detection Implementation**
- Parse **SVG path data** to define collision areas.
- Use **bounding box detection** to determine if a car has collided with the track boundaries.
- Prevent **off-track movement** by detecting **when a car leaves the racing area**.
- Implement a **small slowdown effect** when touching track edges instead of an abrupt stop.

#### **4. Lap Counting & Finish Line Detection**
- Define **checkpoint markers** using SVG reference points.
- Implement a **finish line detection system** that tracks laps.
- Ensure **laps are only counted when fully crossed**, preventing exploits.
- Display the **current lap count & total laps remaining** in the UI.

#### **5. Advanced Track Features**
- Prepare **support for different track surfaces** (wet/dry conditions impact grip).
- Implement **rain overlays** on the track when weather changes.
- Allow track-specific **decorations and environment effects** (e.g., crowd, banners).

---

### 🎯 Step 3: Implement AI Car with Neural Network (Initial Training)
🔹 **Team:** AI Developers  

#### **1. AI Input System & Sensors**
- Implement **ray tracing sensors** to detect track boundaries and obstacles.
- Track **acceleration, braking, speed, and steering angles** as input data.
- AI should predict **collisions ahead of time** and adjust accordingly.

#### **2. Neural Network (NN) Setup in JavaScript**
- Create a **fully connected NN model** that takes in sensor data.
- Train AI using **reinforcement learning** with rewards for optimal driving.
- Store **AI training progress persistently** between races.

#### **3. AI Driving & Decision Making**
- AI learns how to **adjust speed, turn correctly, and avoid crashes**.
- AI can **recognize track limits** and recover from off-track mistakes.
- Different AI models should be tested to find **optimal learning speeds**.

#### **4. AI Overtaking & Collision Avoidance**
- AI should detect **other cars on track** and attempt to overtake.
- Implement **defensive driving maneuvers** if an opponent is nearby.
- AI must avoid **direct collisions by adjusting its path dynamically**.

#### **5. AI Performance & Adaptive Learning**
- AI should **improve over multiple races** based on past experience.
- Implement **difficulty scaling** based on how well the AI performs.
- Tune AI models to **balance competitiveness and fairness**.
